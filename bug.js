This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library.  The issue is that after selecting an image, the image uri is sometimes returned as undefined or null, even though the user successfully selects an image.  This leads to errors when trying to display or process the selected image.  The bug is not consistently reproducible, making it difficult to track down the root cause.  It seems to be related to timing or asynchronous operations.
