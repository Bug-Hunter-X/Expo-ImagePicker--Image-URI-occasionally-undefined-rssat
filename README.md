# Expo ImagePicker: Undefined Image URI Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo ImagePicker library where the returned image URI can be undefined, even after a successful image selection.  The bug is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently. This repository contains both the buggy code and a potential solution.  The bug is likely due to a timing issue or problem with asynchronous operations in the ImagePicker API.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or a similar tool.
4. Select an image.
5. Observe that the URI may sometimes be undefined, resulting in an error.

## Potential Solution

The provided solution uses a more robust error-handling approach to deal with cases where the URI might be undefined or null.  It involves checking for these conditions before proceeding and provides a fallback mechanism in such scenarios.  Although, the root cause of why the URI sometimes returns null is still unclear and may require further investigation into the Expo ImagePicker API itself.
